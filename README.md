# **QUIZ API**
This is an API made in Python in which you can get random quiz questions really easily. 

The topics in this quiz API are art-literature, general-knowledge, geography, history, music, science-nature, sport, tv-films, books and all.

The difficulties in this API are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5

Remember when inserting the topic name or number, don't include the <>, eg. when you want the topic tv-films, do tv-films not <tv-films>.
